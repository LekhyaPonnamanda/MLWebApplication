# MLWebApplication
ML Model trained on huge datasets to predict college students dropout rate
# Project Goal: 
Developed a predictive model using machine learning classification algorithms to identify students likely to drop out.

# Data Sources: 
Utilize data from various sources, including internal and external data from different educational institutions spanning from 2008/2009 to 2018/2019.

# Benefit: 
The model aims to assist educational institutions in resource allocation, early intervention, and support for at-risk students.

# Problem: 
Addressed the issue of student retention and success, with a focus on identifying factors affecting students' retention or dropout.

# Methodology: 
Followed a structured approach, which includes data collection, processing, descriptive analysis, exploratory data analysis, and predictive analysis using machine learning classification algorithms.
# Technologies:
  # Frontend:
     HTML,CSS,JS
  # Backend:
    Python,Flask Framework
  # ML Models:
    Claasification Models
  # Best Performing ML Models
    Random Forest Classifier and SVC(Suuport Vector Classifiers)
